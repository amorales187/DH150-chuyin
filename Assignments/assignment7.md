# High-fidelity Prototype
With my project, *The Stories of Asian America*, I hope to create a space for Asian American history on the internet. This website aims to encourage interethnic solidarity by placing the stories of all Asian American communities (East, Southeast, South Asians) in one place. Whether you are a student, a teacher, or just a life-long learner, you can explore Asian American narratives through our timeline, lesson plans, and videos. 

To bring my project to life, I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. A high-fidelity prototype helps me envision what the end product might look like, and provides a concrete visualization that can be tested with users. These prototypes can emulate a user flow, allowing me to also test how usable the website is. By alternating between designing screens and testing with users, I can iterate towards a better user experience.

## Designing the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
I wanted the website to evoke a sense of calm and wonder, while maintaining a professional appearance. To communicate this, I chose light, modern sans-serif typefaces and a cool, muted color palette. 

For the landing page, I chose to use a landscape photo for the background to draw the user in and create an almost dream-like quality. The mountain scenery depicts the landscape of Indonesia, which helped illustrate the rich, unexplored histories of Asian Americans. I paired a light, sans-serif body text with a heavier, italic serif header font for contrast as well as to embody a sense of sophistication.

## Accessibility Audit
Using the Figma A11y Plugin, I checked that all of the colors passed the WCAG 2.0 AA standard for accessibility.

## Impression Test
For impression test, I recruited classmates to give feedback on the landing page of the website. The test was conducted over Zoom, and I shared my screen for around 10 seconds. To preface the test, I told the participants to think of three adjectives that described the website, as well as what they thought the website was about.

The first participant described the site as **clean**, **concise**, and **pleasing to look at**. They also said the website appeared to be a website containing resources for someone who would want to learn a bit about Asian American history.

The second participant described the site as **pretty**, **calm**, and **trustworthy**. They said the website looked like it provided information about Asian American history.

Overall, the participants seemed to think the website was aesthetically pleasing, easy to understand, and conveyed its purpose.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
In class, I asked a few classmates to complete a cognitive walkthrough on my website. The questions and responses are as follows: 

* What do you think you can do with this website? (showed the Landing page)
> Participants said it seems to be a news/history website and were expecting to learn about Asian American history
> They were a bit confused about the difference between the "Lesson Plans" tab and the "History Videos" tab, assuming that they would contain similar content (ie. a teacher teaching us about history)
> They also said it seems to be centered around the timeline feature because of the "View Timeline" button on the landing page
* Is there anything inconsistent, missing, or confusing?
> They commented that it was difficult to tell that the current website title (Stories of Asian America) was the actual title, and not just a page header

In response to the feedback, I made the following changes:

1) I changed the "Lesson Plans" page title to "For Teachers" to make it clearer that it contained teaching materials

2) I changed the font of the website title (used to be the same font as page headers) and placed a box around it to differentiate it from a page header

## Usability Testing
To check whether the flow for each of the tasks was clear, I conducted usability testing with two participants over Zoom. 

# Tasks
1. Users were asked to navigate to a specific act on the timeline
2. Users had to find more information on a specific timeline event
3. Users were asked to download materials for a lesson plan
4. Users had to view a video documentary

[*Here*](https://forms.gle/4CEuACvMxx3pWUQP6) is a link to the exact questionnaire. 

# Findings
:one: *All participants were able to complete all 4 tasks*
- However, both participants struggled a bit with the second task, finding more information on a specific timeline event. This may have been partially caused by the ambiguous wording on the usability test questionnaire, which did not map onto specific interaction points. I initially left it vague to see how the users would interpret it, since the vague wording would be more akin to a user's goal upon using the timeline. The task was to "find more info", while the button on the page was "Related articles". 
- On that same task, another user tried to click on the "Source" button, which is understandable as part of the task was to "find the original source" of more information (related article)

:two: *Both participants found the website valuable, stating that it was unique.*

:three: *Both participants seemed to have the easiest time with downloading materials for a lesson plan*

:four: *Both participants relied heavily on the filters for completing tasks 1, 2, and 4*

:five: *Both participants expected to be able to click on the headers (of timeline events, lesson plans, videos, etc), rather than just relying on separate buttons*
- In response to this, I made the headers clickable so users could either choose to click a separate button (eg. "View video") or they could just click on the title itself

## Reflection
It was really insightful to interweave both prototyping/designing with user research because testing with users gave me confidence as to whether I was creating things that made sense to the users. It is very difficult to gauge what the user's mental model will be, and I learned new possible ways of interacting with my website with each new participant I observed. 

Based on feedback from my usability tests, I would focus more on creating many avenues to get to a goal because each user seemed to prefer something different. For the timeline feature, I would like to add a filter feature that allows searching by a specific date range so users have an alternative to scrolling manually through the events. I would also start the prototype without any filters (I had it preset to filter to Filipino American history events), since this is more in line with what a first-time user would expect.
