# UX Storytelling

One central way to develop empathy for our users is to take their perspective. We can do this by creating personas, scenarios, user journeys, and empathy maps. 
These transport us out of our own lives and into the lives of our users. Whenever we are designing our product, we can think back to our users' needs through these materials.

Creating personas and scenarios helps us to avoid common pitfalls when designing, such as taking our own perspectives or designing for too broad of an audience. 

In the former case, we assume that our users' needs and mental models are the same as ours, when this is rarely the case. In the latter case, the user is too ambiguous and we may end up designing a product that doesn't satisfy anyone's needs.

## Three features to design
:one: Interactive timeline that shows historical events
- can be sorted by time period, event type, ethnic group

:two: Videos and Interviews discussing contemporary issues and history
- oral histories, interviews of experts, video summaries

:three: Teaching resources to create lesson plans about Asian American history
- worksheets, activities, book recommendations
