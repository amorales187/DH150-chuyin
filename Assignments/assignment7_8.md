# High-fidelity Prototype
With my project, The Stories of Asian America, I hope to create a space for Asian American history on the internet. This website aims to encourage interethnic solidarity by placing the stories of all Asian American communities (East, Southeast, South Asians) in one place. Whether you are a student, a teacher, or just a life-long learner, you can explore Asian American narratives through our timeline, lesson plans, and videos. 

To bring my project to life, I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. A high-fidelity prototype helps me envision what the end product might look like, and provides a concrete visualization that can be tested with users. These prototypes can emulate a user flow, allowing me to also test how usable the website is. By alternating between designing screens and testing with users, I can iterate towards a better user experience.

## Designing the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
I wanted the website to evoke a sense of calm and wonder. To communicate this, I chose light, modern typefaces and a cool, muted color palette. 

Using the Figma A11y Plugin, I checked that all of the colors passed the WCAG 2.0 AA standard for accessibility.

## Impression Test
For impression test, I recruited a friend to give feedback on the landing page of the website. The test was conducted over Zoom, and I shared my screen for around 10 seconds. To preface the test, I told the participant to think of three adjectives that described the website, as well as what they thought the website was about.

The participant described the site as **clean**, **concise**, and **pleasing to look at**. They also said the website appeared to be a website containing resources for someone who would want to learn a bit about Asian American history.

## Iterating
Based on the feedback from my usability testing, impression test, and cognitive walkthroughs, I made the following changes:
