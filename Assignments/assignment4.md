# Contextual Inquiry (CI)

In the process of learning about my target users, I found that many of my design ideas shifted. I thought it would be interesting to document the before and after of my design challenge and target user definition.

## Design Challenge 
Before CI:

How might I design an engaging online experience that highlights the stories of Asian Americans?

After CI:

How might I design an accessible digital experience that disseminates the issues facing AAPI communities and connects people with resources?

## Target Users
Before CI:

I am creating this website for anyone who is interested in Asian American history and contemporary stories about Asian American individuals. However, because of the digital nature of the project, target users must be able to access the internet. 
Specifically, I would like to make this website easy to understand for the public. It does not strive to be a reference for academic researchers.

After CI:

I want to create a website that empowers the public, including academic researchers, to understand the history of Asians in American and to connect with organizations that serve their community.
While it is not intended to be a primary source for academic research, it may provide a broad and structured overview on issues in the Asian American literature.

## Research Methods

To gain a better sense of how I could create a website that is useful to different types of users, I conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, this session had to be conducted remotely over Zoom. 

The session consisted of the following sections:

 **1.	Background questions**
  a.  I wanted to learn about what a typical day looks like for the target users, and how my website could support those daily tasks. I also asked about any enjoyable and frustrating experiences they had that were not necessarily related to searching Asian American history.
  
 **2.	Observation**
  a.	I allowed the user to search up a topic that they wished to learn more about and asked that they think aloud.
  b.	When users refined their search or chose certain results, I asked follow-up questions to clarify their thought process.
  
 **3.	Follow-up questions**
  a.	These were directive. I sought to understand alternative sources of information that users tapped into, besides the one shown in the observation period.

### Contextual Inquiry Guide & Transcript
Before conducting the interview, I outlined some questions in [this guide](https://github.com/yinyinwen/DH150-chuyin/blob/master/images/Contextual%20Inquiry%20Script%20for%20DH%20150.pdf).

## Reflection
Coming into the interview, I thought I had a fairly clear idea of what I wanted to design and who I wanted to design it for. I had envisioned a product that I would have loved to have, especially before coming to college. However, this contextual inquiry allowed me to step out of my own experience and empathize with the user's. 

This interviewee was very in touch with the Asian American cultural and political space, and she showed me how a more experienced user might engage with my product. She uses a variety of different sources to find information on Asian American narratives before, giving me insight on academic and casual sources. One memorable insight from this interview was that she felt that Asian American Studies is very centered in academia, but she still prefers easy-to-consume media when searching for sources. 

In terms of logistics, I found that creating a script for the Contextual Inquiry was quite difficult because it is impossible to know what to expect when immersing oneself in someone else's experience. I had to keep my questions loose, yet still somewhat focused. If I were to do this again, I would definitely try to ask fewer background questions and spend more time observing the user's activities. I would also follow-up more finely with the user's satisfaction and frustrations about their activities.

Talking to this user was a humbling experience, and it taught me that speaking with users directly is essential to understanding them and designing for them.
