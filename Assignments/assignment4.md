# Contextual Inquiry (CI)

In the process of learning about my target users, I found that many of my design ideas shifted. I thought it would be interesting to document the before and after of my design challenge and target user definition.

### Design Challenge 
Before CI:

How might I design an engaging online experience that highlights the stories of Asian Americans?

After CI:

How might I design an accessible digital experience that disseminates the issues facing AAPI communities and connects people with resources?

### Target Users
Before CI:

I am creating this website for anyone who is interested in Asian American history and contemporary stories about Asian American individuals. However, because of the digital nature of the project, target users must be able to access the internet. 
Specifically, I would like to make this website easy to understand for the public. It does not strive to be a reference for academic researchers.

After CI:

I want to create a website that empowers the public, including academic researchers, to understand the history of Asians in American and to connect with organizations that serve their community.
While it is not intended to be a primary source for academic research, it may provide a broad and structured overview on issues in the Asian American literature.

### Research Methods

To gain a better sense of how I could create a website that is useful to different types of users, I conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, these sessions had to be conducted remotely over Zoom. 
The session consisted of the following sections:
1.	Background questions
a.	
2.	Observation
a.	I allowed the user to search up a topic that they wished to learn more about and asked that they think aloud.
b.	When users refined their search or chose certain results, I asked follow-up questions to clarify their thought process.
3.	Follow-up questions
a.	These were directive. I sought to understand alternative sources of information that users tapped into, besides the one shown in the observation period.
