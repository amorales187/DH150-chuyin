# Assignment 2: Usability Testing

## What is usability testing?
Usability testing is a way to gather empirical data from your users that can inform you about how usable your product is. 
This testing can be done early on during the product development as a formative assessment or later after the product launches as validation.
Testing early on can eliminate usability issues before the product is launched, saving time, money, and effort in the long run.
Using testing to validate the product can help ensure that it is up to standards. 
Regardless of when it is done, usability testing gives you real insight on how your users interact with your product and what usability issues they encounter.

To conduct usability testing, you need:

* a location (lab, cafe, etc - anywhere you and the user can sit and use the product)
* people (a moderator is optional, a user is required!)
* a product to test
* a questionnaire

The questionnaire typically consists of realistic tasks that users might do while using your product. These tasks should be outlined very concretely by the moderator, so that they can clearly assess whether the user was able to complete it or not.
Questions aim to measure the efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction of your product. These are the three core principles of usability. 
Besides giving users realistic scenarios in which to use the product, you can include Likert scale measures that capture more subjective aspects of the user experience, such as likelihood that the user would continue to use the product.
