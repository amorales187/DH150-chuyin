# Low-fidelity Prototype

The Stories of Asian America seeks to provide information about Asian American communities to the public. From historical legislation to contemporary social issues, this project hopes to showcase the contributions and experiences of Asian Americans.
This website allows users to:
- Explore the history of Asian American communities with an interactive timeline
- Watch videos and documentaries about art, culture, social issues, and politics
- Find teaching resources to support curriculums related to Asian American topics

To evaluate the logic and flow of the website screens, I created low-fi paper prototypes to test with users early on in the design process.

### Task 1: Find out more about a historical event on the timeline  
Completed? No
- The participant became confused because there was no arrow connecting the interaction point "More info" on the first screen to another screen
- They were also confused as to how the first screen led to the second screen, assuming that clicking on an event in the second screen would let it expand into the view shown on the first screen
- The participant did not know how to get from the first screen to the full details view, so ended up looking around the wireframes
- The participant thought they could click on the arrows to scroll to the next set of events

### Task 2: Download a file for a lesson plan  
Completed? No
- The participant did not notice the menu icon and did not know how to get from the timeline to a different page (ended up just jumping to the Teaching Toolkits screen)
- The participant commented that the "Sort by" option on the Teaching Toolkit page was ambiguous because it allowed you to sort by newest, yet there were no dates listed on each lesson plan
- They appreciated the option to bookmark the lesson 
- They thought the lesson plan page was too text heavy, and would prefer having pictures as well
- The participant also noted that the "Assignments" section of the lesson plans page might be too overwhelming to fit all on the same page, and would prefer if it could be collapsed/moved to a different page

### Task 3: View a video documentary  
Completed? Yes
- The participant commented that navigating to the "Videos" page from the sidebar was confusing because it was unclear as to what kind of videos would be found there
- They would prefer if there was a description of the videos on the main video page to orient the user
- The participant was unclear about how many videos would appear on the first page of the "Videos"
- They were confused as to why the video page for one documentary had a list of tags by it, but the main video page did not allow searching by tags
- They were also confused by the presence of two search bars, as it was unclear whether they both searched the same thing

## Reflection
On creating these wireframes, I realized that because I designed them, it was very difficult to evaluate the logical flow of my own screens. I had spend so much time making each feature, so it was hard to step back and imagine some ways that it might be confusing to a user. Having someone else test my wireframes was immensely valuable and gave me many fresh insights into what the user experience might be like with my website. 

In future wireflows, I would add more arrows to make it clear how certain interaction points lead to other features or screens so that the user does not end up lost. Additionally, I would add more detail to specific hover interactions to emphasize how menus expand. 

For the interactive timeline, I would remove the first view (zoomed in view) of the events because it seemed to cause a lot of confusion for the user. It would be much clearer if I just stuck to the multiple events view of the timeline, and show how it flows into the "More details" view. Additionally, the user was confused as to why there were tags on the timeline, but there was no option to filter by tags. I will add a feature to allow searching/filtering by tags.

For the teaching toolkits, the user thought there was too much information on the lesson plan page and that it was too text-heavy. To address this, I will break up the text with some images relevant to the lesson plan, and I will move the assignments to a new page, showing just the outline on the lesson plan page. 

For the video page, the user was confused by the presence of two search bars, and whether they did the same thing or not. I will clarify the functions of these by labeling the global search bar with "Search this website" and retaining the "Search videos" label on the local video search bar.
