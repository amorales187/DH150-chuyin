# Low-fidelity Prototype

The Stories of Asian America seeks to provide information about Asian American communities to the public. From historical legislation to contemporary social issues, this project hopes to showcase the contributions and experiences of Asian Americans.
This website allows users to:
- Explore the history of Asian American communities with an interactive timeline
- Watch videos and documentaries about art, culture, social issues, and politics
- Find teaching resources to support curriculums related to Asian American topics

To evaluate the logic and flow of the website screens, I created low-fi paper prototypes to test with users early on in the design process.
